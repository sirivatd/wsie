#Where Should I Eat? Thinkful(https://www.thinkful.com/) first capstone portfolio project - a responsive web application that utilizes a third party api

##WSIE allows you to serach for the best restaurants and food places near your location. All you need to do is allow access to your geolocation and WSIE will output different places to go providing the restaurant's name, address, average rating, and average cost for two.

##Use Case Why is this app useful? This app came from the constant problem from deciding where to eat all the time. A quick search on Yelp or Google Places provides almost too much information and made the task of deciding where to eat even more difficult. I wanted to develop a simple, web application that told me exactly where to go and allowed discovery of new places near me. Also, I wanted to make it clear cut how much money I could expect to be spending. No more weird monetary scales but a precise dollar amount I could expect.
